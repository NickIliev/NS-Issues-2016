# Welcome
This repository contains the source code of the UI for NativeScript samples application demonstrating the Angular 2.0 directives. The repository does not contain the source code of UI for NativeScript itself.

The `master` branch contains code currently under development and is not meant to be used with the officially released version of NativeScript UI.

The `release` branch is the default one and is tested with the latest NativeScript UI version available.

##Overview
The UI for NativeScript samples app resides in the **sdkAngular** folder at root repository level. The folder has a standard NativeScript application structure as described in [this article](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tutorial/ng-chapter-0.html). The source code of the samples resides in the folders named after each component available in **UI for NativeScript**. The currently available components are:

- Chart
- Calendar
- SideDrawer
- ListView

## Running **UI for NativeScript** sample app
Make sure you are using NativeScript 2.0+. To see which version of NativeScript you are currently using, type `tns --version` in the console.

Steps to run the sample:

1. `cd sdkAngular`
2. `tns run android` or `tns emulate ios`
